# @solid-soda/evolitions

Often your migration scenarios are as good as ORM you using. Sometimes it leads to inability (without
some extra efforts) to use all features of your chosen DB. This library allows you to write 
migration scenarios using sql and run them with a single console command.

## Usage example

```console
foo@bar:~$ trona-evolutions --init
Initializing evolutions table evolutions

CREATE TABLE evolutions (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    checksum VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    down_script TEXT NOT NULL,
    primary key (id)
);

Evolutions table successfully created!
foo@bar:~$ trona-evolutions
Running evolve script

--- 1.sql ---

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    primary key (id)
);

Evolution is successful!

foo@bar:~$
```

## Installation and configuration

First you need to install trona-evolutions globally via npm

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install -g @solid-soda/evolitions
```

Than you need to setup simple configuration file named .trona-config.js and containing script that
exports object containing fields:
1) runQuery - MANDATORY callback that accepts SQL as it's first argument and returns Promise object 
which is rejected in case of failure of said query and in case of SELECT query successfully 
executed contains array of selected rows in form of an object {[field]: value}.
2) tableName - OPTIONALLY name of tha table that would contain information about evolutions, it would
be created automatically by init script. Default - "evolutions".
3) evolutionsFolderPath - OPTIONALLY relative path to folder that contains .sql files of migration
scripts if form of a sring or string[]. Default - "evolutions".

Example of a config for mysql database:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

const con = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    user: "root",
    password: "123",
    database: 'playground',
});

con.connect(function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("Connected!");
});

module.exports = {
    evolutionsFolderPath: ['db', 'evolutions'],
    tableName: 'my_evolutions',
    runQuery (query) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            con.query(query, (err, result) => {
                if (err) {
                    reject(err);
                } else {
                    resolve(result);
                }
            });
        })
    }
}
```

After module have been installed run command and .trona-config.js created run

```console
foo@bar:~$ trona-evolutions --init
```

This command will create table with information about evolutions.
Than create a folder with for your evolutions script and add your first evolution to it. Note the
rules which you should follow writing said evolutions:

1) Name file {evolution-number}.sql (e.g. 1.sql)
2) Write up and fallback scripts in file and separate them via "#DOWN" comment as at the
example below

Folder content example:
```
- evolutions
    - 1.sql
    - 2.sql
    - 3.sql
    ...
```

Evolution contents example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    primary key (id)
);

#DOWN

DROP TABLE Customers;
```

Run command 
```console
foo@bar:~$ trona-evolutions
```

## Usage
After you managed to successfully setup trona-evolutions you can run trona-evolutions-run command.
This command will automatically detect any changed or new files in your evolutions folder, run
respected fallback scripts if needed and than evolve your databae schema (e. g. if you have 1.sql,
2.sql, and 3.sql evolutions already in your database, you have changed 2.sql and added 4.sql it will 
run fallback for 3.sql and 2.sql and than run 2.sql, 3.sql, and 4.sql scripts)
